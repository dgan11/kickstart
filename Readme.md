Creating a crowdfunding type Web3 App

### Get Started
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`


### Why Next.js
React takes all JS code and serves it to the browser. NextJs does server side rendering -- Next tries to render all the JS code itself first and then sends the HTML to the browser (Note: this means a user does not even have to have a wallet connected on their browser to see blockchain data. TLDR; the data fetching logic happens on the server instead of the browser!)
